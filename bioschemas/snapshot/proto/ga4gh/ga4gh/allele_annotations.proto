/*
The VariantAnnotation record groups different types of annotation records by
Variant.

The TranscriptEffect sub record holds information on the effect of a specific
allele on a specific transcript. As Variants may overlap multiple transcripts,
they may have multiple TranscriptEffect records. Variants with multiple
alternate alleles will have multiple TranscriptEffect records per transcript. (2
alternate alleles x 3 transcripts = 6 TranscriptEffect records)

VariantAnnotation records belong to VariantAnnotationSets. VariantAnnotationSets
are created by comparing a number of Variants from a VariantSet to a specific
set of reference data using specific software tools. A VariantAnnotationSet
contains information on reference data and software versions used in calculating
the annotation; it is essential this information is exhaustive.
