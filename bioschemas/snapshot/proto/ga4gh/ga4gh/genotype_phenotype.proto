/*
This protocol defines the associations between genotype
and phenotype (G2P).  Associations can be made as a
result of literature curation, computational modeling,
inference, etc., and modeled and shared using this schema.


Here, we follow the dogma of:
      Genotype + Environment = Phenotype

Where a G2P association is between the G(enotype) in the context of
some E(environment), which gives rise to a P(henotype). These
associations have further evidence, provenance, and attribution.
We leverage the GenomicFeature in the sequenceAnnotation schema here
as it can accomodate any genomic feature from a single nucleotide variation
(SNV), up through a gene, and/or complex rearrangements.  Each can
be modeled as genomic features, and generally linked to a phenotype.
Collections of these features can represent a genotype at different levels
of completeness.  Therefore, we can represent single allelic variation,
allelic complement, and multiple variants in a genotype that can each or
collectively be associated with a phenotype.
To enable standardized integration, this schema relies heavily on
OntologyTerms, for typing phenotype, genomic features, and levels
of evidence.  Suggested ontologies to leverage include (with browser links):

  - Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO): http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=hp
  - Disease Ontology (DO): http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/DOID_4
  - Sequence Ontology (SO): http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/
  - Evidence Code Ontology (ECO): http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=ECO
  - Phenotypic Qualities (PATO): http://www.ontobee.org/browser/index.php?o=PATO
