// This protocol defines annotations on GA4GH genomic sequences It includes two
// types of annotations: continuous and discrete hierarchical.
//
// The discrete hierarchical annotations are derived from the Sequence Ontology
// (SO) and GFF3 work
//
//    http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml
//
// The goal is to be able to store annotations using the GFF3 and SO conceptual
// model, although there is not necessarly a one-to-one mapping in Protobuf messages
// to GFF3 records.
//
// The minimum requirement is to be able to accurately represent the current
// state of the art annotation data and the full SO model.  Feature is the
// core generic record which corresponds to the a GFF3 record.
