// A BioSample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate

// Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g.
// genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same BioSample.
// In the context of the GA4GH metadata schema, BioSample constitutes the central
